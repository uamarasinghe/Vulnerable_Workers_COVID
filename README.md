Understanding the vulnerability of workers during COVID

In order to understand the vulnerability of Ontario's essential sales and sevice workers, we (MaRS Data Catalyst) [mapped the list of designated essential workplaces in Ontario to industries (NAICS)] (https://github.com/marsdd/MDCPublic/tree/master/COVID19_Essential_Workplaces) to understand (1) how many sales and service workers in Ontario are affected by the March 24 and April 3 provincial COVID-19 measures that allocate essential versus  non-essential occupations; (2) how potential COVID-19 exposure differs by occupation within this sector; and (3) how wage differences amplify the risk of exposure for low-income workers.

Our findings have been published [HERE](https://www.marsdd.com/research-and-insights/covid-19-and-ontarios-sales-and-service-workers-who-is-most-vulnerable/) by MaRS Discovery Districut.
